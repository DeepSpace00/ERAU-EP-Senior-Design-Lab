* [Prusa Slicer Configuration Bundle](https://github.com/DeepSpace00/ERAU-EP-Senior-Design-Lab/blob/main/PrusaSlicer_config_bundle.ini) is a configuration profile for the Ender 3 Pro and Ender 3 V2 printers in the lab. This profile has all of the current (as of writing this) filiment settings and configurations. [How to import config bundle](https://www.filamentone.com/blogs/3d-printing-blog/prusa-slicer-how-to-import-configuration-bundle)
* [Prusa Slicer Configuration Bundle w/ Printers](https://github.com/DeepSpace00/ERAU-EP-Senior-Design-Lab/blob/main/PrusaSlicer_config_bundle_without_printers.ini) is the same as above, but with the printers loaded.

## 3D Printers
There are two printers in the lab. An Ender 3 Pro and an Ender 3 V2. **DO NOT MODIFY THE FIRMWARE**, it is configured correctly and modifying it may lead to the printer not working. Take precaution and **do not install bed leveling sensors**. Do it right and level it by hand.
