Software, configurations, and documentation for the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Engineering Physics Senior Design Lab
## 3D Printing
### Prusa Slicer
**[How to use Prusa Slicer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz2Soog4HkQ)**
* [Prusa Slicer Configuration Bundle](https://github.com/DeepSpace00/ERAU-EP-Senior-Design-Lab/blob/main/PrusaSlicer_config_bundle.ini) is a configuration profile for the Ender 3 Pro and Ender 3 V2 printers in the lab. This profile has all of the current (as of writing this) filiment settings and configurations. [How to import config bundle](https://www.filamentone.com/blogs/3d-printing-blog/prusa-slicer-how-to-import-configuration-bundle)
* [Prusa Slicer Configuration Bundle w/ Printers](https://github.com/DeepSpace00/ERAU-EP-Senior-Design-Lab/blob/main/PrusaSlicer_config_bundle_without_printers.ini) is the same as above, but with the printers loaded.

### Lab 3D Printers
There are two printers in the lab. An Ender 3 Pro and an Ender 3 V2. **DO NOT MODIFY THE FIRMWARE**, it is configured correctly and modifying it may lead to the printer not working. Take precaution and **DO NOT INSTALL BED LEVELING SENSORS**. Do it right and level it by hand.

### Filaments
There are a few different types of filament in the lab and they each have their own uses. Below is a guide on helping you choose which one to use as well as a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycGDR752fT0).
* PLA: A good filament for rapid prototyping. It is extreamly easy to use, prints at relativly low tempretures, and does not require an enclosure. It is not as strong as other filaments, but is a good choice for draft printing due to it's easyness to print and low cost
* ABS: A stronger filament compared to PLA and is less brittle and can handle higher tempretures. Requires an enclosure.
* PETG:
* NYLON:
* TPU:
